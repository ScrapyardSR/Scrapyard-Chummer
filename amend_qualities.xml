      <name>Groveler</name>
      <notes>The Groveler quality (Kill Code) adjusts the Limit of your next Resonance action to the number of datachip sets consumed. It does not change Fading.

Furthermore, for clarity: destroying one or more sets of datachips can be done as a Use Simple Device action. You must physically destroy the datachips, and must do so yourself, and so must be in AR or have a method to control your ambulation while in VR. A character can destroy chips in AR and then switch to VR to perform the Complex Form they intend.

      <name>Instinctive Hack</name>
      <notes>Cost: 2 Karma You haven’t lived this long by treating hacking as a luxury. You use it to survive. When you see life going lopsided, your gut reaction is to hack for your life. Most of the time, you don’t even need to think about it.
Unless surprised, you can make one of the following actions before Initiative is rolled for the first time in a combat (Physical or Matrix): Brute Force, Hack on the Fly, or Matrix Perception.
If two or more characters have this quality, use ERIC (Edge, Reaction, Intuition, Coin toss) to decide who goes first.

      <notes>In addition to a fake SIN granted by this quality, your full biometrics are on file with the Global SIN registry, and you should specify where that SIN originates

Even when broadcasting a different SIN, if your biometrics are scanned, the scanner will test first against the R3 Fake SIN to see if the quality is triggered.

      <name>Candle in the Darkness</name>
      <notes>Effective Loyalty cannot exceed 6.
Loyalty 6 contacts are "immune" to this quality - they will not think less of you solely due to you tarnishing your reputation. You'd have to do far worse to them to lose loyalty.
Loyalty 1 contacts whose effective loyalty becomes 0 (generally) won't dump you permanently, but they will NOT help you in any way until you make amends and their effective loyalty increases above 0 again.
